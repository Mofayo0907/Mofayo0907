# Heyyyy, You found me!

My name is Ogunmodede Joy. I'm a Developer trying out frontend at the moment and it's looking like my calling. I code and write anything. I'm looking forward to collaborations, discussions and projects involving web development and anything interesting.

I am in a toxic relationship with that yellow and black language
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full stack web development.

I am an electrical engineering student at LAUTECH, Ogbomoso. I am also a software engineering student - ALXAfrica and at SQI College of ICT, Ogbomoso.
 - I'm currently learning Javascript and Python.

I hope you find what you seek.
